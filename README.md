# R Projects – Statistical Analysis Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of R-based projects demonstrating statistical modelling, 
data analysis, and reproducible research practices. The projects reflect applications in 
psychology, cognitive science, and related fields, with an emphasis on both methodological 
rigour and clear communication of results.

## ⚠️ Viewing Reports  

Please note: GitHub does not render `.html` files directly in the browser.  
To view the analysis reports:  
1. Download the desired `.html` file to your computer.  
2. Open it in any web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).  


## Focus Areas
- Data wrangling, visualisation, and reporting with the **tidyverse**  
- Generalised Linear Mixed Models (**GLMMs**) and multilevel modelling  
- Bayesian inference and hierarchical modelling with **brms**  
- Exploratory data analysis and hypothesis-driven confirmatory analysis  
- Reproducible reporting with **R Markdown** and **HTML outputs**

## Repository Structure
- Each subfolder contains an independent project with:
  - An RMarkdown (`.Rmd`) script of the analysis  
  - A compiled HTML report of results  
  - A project-specific `README.md` with context and details  

## Purpose
This repository is intended as a professional portfolio, showcasing proficiency in statistical 
analysis, modelling, and reproducible research using R. While example datasets may come 
from psychology and cognitive science, the methods are broadly applicable across the 
behavioural and social sciences.

## Tools
- R  
- tidyverse, lme4, brms, ggplot2  
- knitr, rmarkdown
